The following dependencies and steps are needed for Raspbian Stretch released in November 2017.

Prequisites may change with newer versions.

This has been tested with Raspberry Pi Zero W.

Note that it may be tough to get everything + the blockchain installed on a 4GB flash card.  It's recommended you use an 8GB or 16GB flash card.
